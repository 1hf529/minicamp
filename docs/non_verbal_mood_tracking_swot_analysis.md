   - Challenges in maintaining accuracy across diverse populations and environments.

2. **User Adoption Barriers**:
   - Requires users to change habits and learn new interaction paradigms.
   - May face resistance from users who prefer traditional mood tracking methods.

3. **Privacy Concerns**:
   - Collection of visual, audio, or physiological data raises significant privacy issues.
   - Need for robust encryption and data protection measures.

4. **Technical Complexity**:
   - Requires integration of multiple sensing technologies (voice analysis, facial recognition, physiological sensors).
   - Need for advanced AI/ML algorithms to interpret non-verbal emotional cues accurately.

## Opportunities (机会)
1. **Market Growth**:
   - The mental health app market has shown significant growth, especially following increased awareness of mental health issues.
   - Increasing adoption of digital mental health tools by healthcare providers.

2. **Technological Advancement**:
   - Improvements in wearable technology enable continuous monitoring of physiological indicators.
   - Advancements in AI/ML models for interpreting non-verbal emotional cues with higher accuracy.

3. **Healthcare Integration**:
   - Potential for integration with healthcare systems and electronic health records.
   - Opportunity to support clinical decision-making through continuous emotional monitoring.

4. **Regulatory Development**:
   - Emerging regulatory frameworks for digital health applications may provide clearer guidelines for development.

## Threats (威胁)
1. **Privacy and Security Risks**:
   - Growing concern about data collection and protection in mental health applications.
   - Potential for data breaches or misuse of sensitive emotional data.

2. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - Complex regulatory landscape for health applications and data privacy.
   - Need to comply with various international data protection regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).

3. **User Trust Issues**:
   - Skepticism about the accuracy and reliability of emotion detection technology.
   - Concerns about how emotional data will be used or shared.

4. **Technical Limitations**:
   - Difficulty in accurately interpreting complex emotional states from non-verbal cues.
   - Variability in emotional expression across different cultures and individuals.
