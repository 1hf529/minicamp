# Project Analysis: Non-Verbal Mood Tracking and Visualization

## 1. Concise Summary
An application that enables users to record and visualize their emotions without relying on text, using alternative input methods like colors, images, sounds, or gestures.

## 2. Target Users
- People who have difficulty expressing emotions verbally or in writing (e.g., children, individuals with autism, or those who are illiterate).
- Users who prefer quick, intuitive emotional logging without the effort of writing.
- Individuals interested in exploring non-traditional ways of self-reflection and emotional awareness.

## 3. Core Use Scenarios
- Daily mood logging using simple visual or auditory inputs (e.g., selecting a color or emoji that represents the day's feeling).
- Tracking emotional patterns over time through visual dashboards (e.g., mood charts, heatmaps).
- Supporting therapeutic practices where non-verbal expression is preferred or necessary.

## 4. Key Assumptions
- Users are willing to adopt alternative input methods for emotional expression.
- Visual or auditory cues can adequately represent the complexity of human emotions.
- The platform can accurately interpret and translate non-verbal inputs into meaningful data for visualization.

## Preliminary Evaluation

### Value
- **High Potential**: Addresses an underserved segment (non-verbal emotion trackers) and offers a novel approach to emotional self-awareness.
- **Therapeutic Applications**: Could be valuable in educational or therapeutic contexts for specific user groups.

### Technical Feasibility
- **Moderate to High**: 
  - Existing technologies like image recognition, voice analysis, and gesture detection can be leveraged.
  - Visualization tools are well-established and accessible.
  - Integration with mobile platforms (touch, camera, microphone) is straightforward.

### Risks
- **Interpretation Accuracy**: Non-verbal cues can be ambiguous, leading to potential misinterpretation of user emotions.
- **User Adoption**: Requires users to change habits and learn a new interaction paradigm.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Collection of visual or audio data may raise privacy issues.

## Next Steps for Detailed Evaluation
1. Conduct user research to validate assumptions about non-verbal emotional expression.
2. Explore existing solutions and identify gaps in the market.
3. Prototype core interaction models (e.g., color-based mood selection, voice tone analysis).
4. Assess data privacy and security requirements for handling non-text emotional data.
