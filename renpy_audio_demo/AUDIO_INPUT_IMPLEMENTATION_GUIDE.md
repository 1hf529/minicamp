# Ren'Py Audio Input Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to implement audio input functionality in Ren'Py visual novels. The implementation allows users to interact with the game using voice commands in addition to traditional text input.

## Implementation Approach

Based on our research and analysis, we recommend a hybrid approach that combines Python library integration for desktop platforms with platform-specific solutions for mobile devices.

## Core Components

### 1. Audio Recording

The audio recording functionality uses PyAudio to capture audio from the microphone:

```renpy
init python:
    try:
        import pyaudio
        import wave
        audio_supported = True
    except:
        audio_supported = False
    
    # Audio recording parameters
    AUDIO_CHUNK = 1024
    AUDIO_FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16 if audio_supported else None
    AUDIO_CHANNELS = 1
    AUDIO_RATE = 44100
    AUDIO_RECORD_SECONDS = 5
    
    def record_audio_simple(filename="recorded_audio.wav", duration=5):
        """
        Simple audio recording function (requires compatible environment)
        """
        if not audio_supported:
            renpy.notify("Audio recording not supported in this environment")
            return False
            
        try:
            # Initialize PyAudio
            audio = pyaudio.PyAudio()
            
            # Open stream
            stream = audio.open(format=AUDIO_FORMAT,
                                channels=AUDIO_CHANNELS,
                                rate=AUDIO_RATE,
                                input=True,
                                frames_per_buffer=AUDIO_CHUNK)
            
            renpy.notify("Recording for %d seconds..." % duration)
            
            # Record audio
            frames = []
            for i in range(0, int(AUDIO_RATE / AUDIO_CHUNK * duration)):
                data = stream.read(AUDIO_CHUNK)
                frames.append(data)
            
            renpy.notify("Recording finished.")
            
            # Stop and close stream
            stream.stop_stream()
            stream.close()
            audio.terminate()
            
            # Save audio to file
            wf = wave.open(filename, 'wb')
            wf.setnchannels(AUDIO_CHANNELS)
            wf.setsampwidth(audio.get_sample_size(AUDIO_FORMAT))
            wf.setframerate(AUDIO_RATE)
            wf.writeframes(b''.join(frames))
            wf.close()
            
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            renpy.notify("Recording failed: " + str(e))
            return False
```

### 2. Speech Recognition

Speech recognition is implemented using the SpeechRecognition library:

```renpy
init python:
    try:
        import speech_recognition as sr
        speech_supported = True
    except:
        speech_supported = False
    
    def recognize_speech_from_file(filename="recorded_audio.wav"):
        """
        Convert recorded audio to text using speech recognition
        """
        if not speech_supported:
            renpy.notify("Speech recognition not supported in this environment")
            return "Speech recognition not available"
            
        try:
            # Initialize recognizer
            recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
            
            # Load audio file
            with sr.AudioFile(filename) as source:
                audio_data = recognizer.record(source)
            
            # Recognize speech
            text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)
            return text
        except sr.UnknownValueError:
            return "Could not understand audio"
        except sr.RequestError as e:
            return "Could not request results; {0}".format(e)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Speech recognition failed: " + str(e)
```

### 3. User Interface

A custom screen provides the audio input interface:

```renpy
screen audio_input_screen():
    frame:
        xalign 0.5
        yalign 0.5
        xpadding 20
        ypadding 20
        vbox:
            spacing 20
            
            label "Audio Input" size 24
            
            if audio_supported:
                textbutton "Record Audio (5 seconds)" action Function(record_audio_simple, "user_recording.wav", 5)
                
                if renpy.exists("user_recording.wav"):
                    text "Recording ready for processing"
                    textbutton "Process Audio" action [SetVariable("processing", True), 
                        SetVariable("recognized_text", recognize_speech_from_file("user_recording.wav"))]
                
                if processing:
                    if recognized_text:
                        label "Recognized Text:"
                        text recognized_text
                    else:
                        text "Processing audio..."
            else:
                text "Audio input is not supported in this environment."
                text "Please use text input instead."
            
            textbutton "Back" action Return()
```

## Integration with Game Logic

The audio input is integrated into the main game loop:

```renpy
label chat_loop:
    # Menu for input method selection
    menu:
        "Select input method:"
        "Text input":
            $ user_input = renpy.input("You: ", length=100)
        "Audio input" if audio_supported:
            call screen audio_input_screen
            $ user_input = recognized_text if recognized_text else ""
        "Exit":
            "AI" "Goodbye! Thanks for chatting."
            return
    
    # Process user input
    if user_input.lower() == "quit" or user_input.lower() == "exit":
        "AI" "Goodbye! Thanks for chatting."
        return
    
    # Handle empty input
    if user_input.strip() == "":
        if not audio_supported or not recognized_text:
            "AI" "Please enter a message."
            jump chat_loop
    
    # Process with AI (mock implementation)
    $ ai_response = call_llm_api(user_input)
    "AI" "[ai_response]"
    
    # Reset variables for next iteration
    $ recognized_text = ""
    $ processing = False
    
    # Continue chat loop
    jump chat_loop
```

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Desktop Platforms

For desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux), the Python library integration approach works well:

1. Install PyAudio and SpeechRecognition libraries
2. Handle platform-specific installation requirements
3. Test audio compatibility in the target environment

### Mobile Platforms

For mobile platforms, platform-specific solutions are recommended:

#### Android

Use Pyjnius to access Android's SpeechRecognizer API:

```renpy
# Android implementation would use Pyjnius
# This is a conceptual example
init python:
    try:
        from jnius import autoclass
        # Access Android SpeechRecognizer API
        # Implementation details would go here
    except:
        # Handle case where Pyjnius is not available
        pass
```

#### iOS

Use Pyobjus to access iOS Speech framework:

```renpy
# iOS implementation would use Pyobjus
# This is a conceptual example
init python:
    try:
        # Access iOS Speech framework through Pyobjus
        # Implementation details would go here
    except:
        # Handle case where Pyobjus is not available
        pass
```

### Web Platform

For web deployments, use the Web Speech API:

```renpy
# Web implementation would use Ren'Py's web capabilities
# This is a conceptual example
init python:
    # Access Web Speech API through Ren'Py's web integration
    # Implementation details would go here
```

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

1. Library availability checks
2. Recording failure notifications
3. Speech recognition error messages
4. Graceful fallback to text input

## Best Practices

1. Always check for library availability before using audio functions
2. Provide clear user feedback during recording and processing
3. Handle errors gracefully with informative messages
4. Implement timeouts for recording to prevent indefinite waits
5. Clean up temporary files after processing
6. Test on target platforms before deployment

## Future Enhancements

1. Real-time audio processing instead of file-based
2. Multiple language support for speech recognition
3. Audio visualization during recording
4. Improved error handling with recovery options
5. Offline speech recognition engines
6. Custom recognition models for specific use cases

This implementation provides a solid foundation for audio input in Ren'Py games that can be extended based on specific project requirements.
